This project implements a **content-based movie recommendation system** using the MovieLens 100K dataset. It analyzes movie features and user ratings to suggest similar movies with predicted ratings.

## Features
- Performed **EDA** to explore genre distributions and user preferences
- Cleaned and structured **100K+ records** for modeling
- Built a **content-based filtering** system using cosine similarity and correlation
- Displayed **top recommendations** with predicted rating outputs

## Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn  
- Seaborn, Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
- [MovieLens 100K Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/)

## How to Run
1. Clone this repo  
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter/Colab  
3. Run each cell sequentially to load data, explore, and generate recommendations

## Output
Input: Movie title  
Output: List of similar movies with correlation scores and predicted ratings
